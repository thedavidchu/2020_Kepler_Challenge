/* SQL database to store client queries

You are Chief Troubleshooter at a SAAS company called Bloop. Your service has a built-in feedback form
that users can fill out to submit bugs or suggestions to the Bloop team. You must manage the timely influx
and resolution of these user submissions. Design an SQL database structure that will account for all of the
information you think you might need to handle such a task. Provide the tables, fields, and relationships
for your database. As Chief Troubleshooter, what are some common queries that you might employ?
Provide the full SQL code for one such SQL query.
Bloopâ€™s user base is old-fashioned; 70% of the feedback forms you receive are mailed in by paper
envelope. How do you account for this in the management of your database?
If you like, you may refine what the Bloop service does to help develop your thoughts.
